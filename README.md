Technical Writer | Content Developer | Digital Asset Manager
------------------------------------------------------------
## Introduction
**Welcome to my Technical Writing Portfolio on GitHub!** Thanks for visiting. Although my most recent work experience covers technical proposal development for IT and other technology companies, the bulk of my technical writing experience is in technical documentation and content development on a wide variety of topics and for many different audiences.

I have an MA in Digital Media Communication and another MA in Communication Studies. My IT industry experience consists of undergraduate coursework in computer science, certification in Configuration Management process implementation, and certification as an Information Systems Security Officer. This diverse IT background, along with some hands-on programming experience, have allowed me to effectively convey technical concepts and solutions for several major technology and IT service companies providing products and services in the federal energy and IT space.

While some of my examples are not strictly IT or software related, they showcase my abilities in process development, analysis, and thorough documentation. Additional examples will be added here as they are developed.  

Additional types of writing samples are available at my [Digital Portfolio site](https://sites.google.com/view/thestevethomaswritingportfolio/home).

I have created a wide variety of digital content / technical documentation for multiple commercial, corporate, and federal audiences. My technical background areas include: 
- Computer Science
- Basic Networking
- Information Security
- Green Energy Technologies
- Physical Access and Security / Intrusion Detection Systems
- Cloud Computing
- Health Information Technology
- Naval Shipbuilding
